Virtual Concierge Creator and Management System

##Background
Visitors to multi-building premises and large buildings find it difficult to navigate without the assistance of a concierge. 
Virtual concierges does exist to help visitors with navigation,
but the already existing virtual concierges is mostly limited to a single building and doesn't allow navigation to other buildings on a premises.
The most existing virtual concierges are user friendly, but from the developer and/or administrator's side,
it is normally a bad experience to manage, maintain or create a virtual concierge. 
The current problem is not the idea of the virtual concierges, 
but rather the development and maintenance of virtual concierge systems. 
There is a need for maintainable, manageable and expandable virtual concierges.
From the administrator's side,it can be difficult and time consuming to change destinations' names of the virtual concierge.
