Virtual Concierge Creator and Management System

##Background
Visitors to multi-building premises and large buildings find it difficult to navigate without the assistance of a concierge. 
Virtual concierges do exist to help visitors with navigation, but existing virtual concierges are mostly limited to a single building premises and don't allow navigation to other buildings on the premise.

Most existing virtual concierges are user friendly but are pose a bad experience to manage, maintain or create a virtual concierge from the developer and/or administrator's side.

The current problem is not the inherent idea of virtual concierges, but rather the development and maintenance of virtual concierge systems.

There is a need for maintainable, manageable and expandable virtual concierges.
From the administrator's side,it can be difficult and time consuming to change destination names on  the virtual concierge.
